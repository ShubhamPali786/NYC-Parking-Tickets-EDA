Apply concept of Big data analytics using Spark
<h2>Objective of Case Study</h2>
<ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Primarily, this&nbsp;case study is meant as a deep dive into the usage of Spark. As you saw while working with Spark, its&nbsp;syntax behaves differently from a regular Python&nbsp;syntax. One of the major objectives of this case study is to gain&nbsp;familiarity with how analysis works in PySpark&nbsp;as opposed to base Python.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Learning the basic idea behind using functions in PySpark can help in using other libraries like SparkR. If you are in a company where R&nbsp;is a primary language, you can easily pick up SparkR&nbsp;syntax and use Sparkâ€™s processing power.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">The process of running a model-building command boils down to a few lines of code. While drawing inferences from data, the most time-consuming step is preparing the data up to the point of model building. So, this case study will focus more on exploratory analysis.</p></li></ul>
